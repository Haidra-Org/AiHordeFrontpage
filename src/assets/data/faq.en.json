    "question": "How does this all work?",
    "answer": "<p>The AI Horde is a free community service that connects people who need AI-generated content with volunteers who share their computer power. Think of it like Folding@home or SETI@home, but for generative AI.</p><p>When you submit a request (for example, \"a painting of a sunset over mountains\"), the system finds available volunteer computers (<a href='/faq#workers'>workers</a>) that can process your job. Your request is queued based on your <a href='/faq#kudos'>kudos</a> balance—users with more kudos get faster service, but anyone can use it for free.</p><p>Workers continuously poll the horde for new jobs, generate the results, and return them to you. You can check active workers and their status on the <a href='/details/workers'>active workers page</a>, and explore available models on the <a href='/details/models'>models page</a>.</p>",

  {
    "question": "What are Kudos?",
    "answer": "<p>Kudos are the priority system that determines your position in the queue when you make a request. The more kudos you have, the faster your requests will be processed. They are the <strong>fundamental unit of exchange of resources</strong> on the AI Horde.</p><p><a href='/contribute/joining'>Workers</a> earn kudos when they complete jobs, and users spend kudos to prioritize their requests. <strong>Kudos never expire</strong> and can be freely traded between users, but <strong>cannot be sold for money</strong>—this is strictly against our <a href='/terms'>Terms of Service</a>.</p><p>Users cannot go below a certain minimum kudos balance, so everyone can still submit requests for free.

  },
  {
    "question": "How do I earn Kudos?",
    "answer": "<p>The best way to earn kudos is to <a href='/contribute/joining'>run a worker</a>! You will earn kudos for each request you fulfill based on its difficulty and complexity.</p><p>Additionally, workers earn uptime kudos every 10 minutes for staying online and available, even when not actively processing jobs. Workers that serve multiple models earn increased uptime kudos.</p><p>If you don't have the hardware to run a worker, see the <a href='/faq#i-dont-have-a-powerful-gpu-how-can-i-earn-kudos'>\"I don't have a powerful GPU\"</a> section for alternative ways to earn kudos.</p>",
    "section": "Kudos"
  },
  {
    "question": "How is image Kudos consumption calculated?",
    "answer": "<p>The kudos cost reflects the amount of processing required to generate the image.</p><p>Since each payload on the horde can have many variables affecting its speed, we have trained a neural network that takes a request payload as input and calculates the required kudos based on how much faster or slower it would generate compared to a baseline. The baseline is <strong>10 kudos for a 50-step 512x512 image</strong>. If a payload is expected to take twice as long, it will cost 20 kudos.</p><p>The AI Horde API provides a <code>dry_run</code> payload key. When set to true, it returns the kudos cost for an image without actually generating it.</p><p>Additionally, there is a \"horde tax\" representing infrastructure costs for each request. These kudos are not received by the worker but are permanently burned:</p><ul><li>1 kudos tax per request (applied even if the request is cancelled, faulted, or aborted)</li><li>1 kudos tax per job in a request</li><li>+20% kudos burn for requesting only fast workers</li><li>+10% kudos burn for requesting a worker blacklist</li></ul>",

  {
    "question": "I don't have a powerful GPU. How can I earn Kudos?",
    "answer": "<p>Kudos are used to encourage positive behavior in the community. There are ways to earn kudos besides generating images for others (although that's the best way):</p><ul><li>If you have at least 2GB VRAM, you can run an <strong>alchemist</strong> worker, which performs image interrogation and post-processing tasks.</li><li>Rate images. Most <a href='/guis-and-tools'>clients</a> allow you to rate images while waiting, which earns kudos per rating. You can also rate images you generated for a kudos refund! <a href='https://tinybots.net/artbot/rate' target='_blank'>Artbot has an easy rating page</a>.</li><li>Fulfill a bounty from our <a href='https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn' target='_blank'>Discord</a> bounties forum.</li><li>Subscribe to <a href='https://www.patreon.com/db0' target='_blank'>the Patreon</a> supporting AI Horde development (or use <a href='/contribute/donate'>other donation methods</a>).</li><li>Share cool art in our <a href='https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn' target='_blank'>Discord</a>.</li><li>Politely ask others to transfer kudos to you in our Discord server.

  {
    "question": "Can I sell my Kudos?",
    "answer": "<p><strong>No!</strong> Kudos have no inherent monetary value, and we do not allow anyone to exchange kudos for money. This is a core principle of the AI Horde designed to prevent commodification and ensure equitable access to resources.</p><p>Attempting to bypass this rule is an existential threat to the AI Horde. <strong>If you exchange money for kudos and we discover it, we may zero out your account and the account of the person you bought from!</strong></p><p>Kudos can be freely traded between users as gifts or gestures of gratitude (you can <a href='/v2-transfer'>transfer kudos here</a>), but never for currency, cryptocurrency, or any other unit of monetary exchange.

  {
    "question": "Is Kudos a cryptocurrency?",
    "answer": "<p><strong>No!</strong> Kudos are completely centralized and do not involve any blockchain technology.

  {
    "question": "What is a worker?",
    "answer": "<p>A worker is a computer, usually with a mid-range or higher GPU, that has installed specific software to generate images via Stable Diffusion or text via Large Language Models locally.</p><p>It connects to the horde through what we call the \"bridge\"—a software component that handles communication between the worker and the AI Horde API. The worker constantly polls the horde for new jobs and receives kudos in return for completing them.</p><p>There are three main types of workers:</p><ul><li><strong>Dreamers:</strong> Image generation workers using Stable Diffusion, SDXL, Flux, and more</li><li><strong>Scribes:</strong> Text generation workers using Large Language Models</li><li><strong>Alchemists:</strong> Image processing workers for tasks like upscaling, face-fixing, and image interrogation</li></ul><p>Visit our <a href='/contribute/joining'>becoming a worker</a> page to learn how to set up your own worker.</p>",
    "section": "Workers"
  },
  {
    "question": "What do workers gain from participating?",
    "answer": "<p>Generating images for others 24/7 does consume electricity, which we acknowledge.</p><p>People contribute to the horde for many reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Converting GPU downtime to value:</strong> If you're not using your GPU 24/7, you can \"bank\" kudos for when you need faster service.</li><li><strong>Converting lower-end GPUs to higher-end results:</strong> Accumulate kudos with a modest GPU, then use them to request generations from more powerful hardware.</li><li><strong>Improved concurrency:</strong> Build up kudos to make multiple requests simultaneously across different workers.</li><li><strong>Building applications:</strong> Developers can power their own Stable Diffusion or KoboldAI-based tools using the horde infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Productive heating:</strong> Yes, some people really do use it to warm their rooms!</li><li><strong>Altruism:</strong> Support the project and help others access AI for free. Unspent kudos are effectively a donation to the community.</li></ul><p>Read more about <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/why.md' target='_blank'>our motivations</a> for running this service.</p>",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can workers see my prompts or generations?",
    "answer": "<p><em>Technically</em>, yes. While the worker software and bridge code are not designed to allow this, the software runs on someone else's computer and is open source. Anyone with the know-how can modify their code to view all prompts passing through or save the results they generate.</p><p>However, workers do not have any identifying information about individual requestors—<strong>they cannot see your user ID, username, or IP address</strong>. The system is designed to protect user privacy while allowing workers to process jobs.</p><p>As a best practice, always request generations as if you were posting in a public forum, like using a Discord bot. While the horde provides reasonable privacy protections, treating requests as potentially public is a good security habit.</p>",
    "section": "Workers"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I turn off my worker whenever I want?",
    "answer": "<p>Yes! Workers are not required to stay online at all times. We only ask that you put your worker into <strong>maintenance mode</strong> before shutting it down to avoid interrupting any jobs it may be processing.</p><p>When in maintenance mode, your worker finishes its current jobs but doesn't accept new ones. You can manage your workers from your <a href='/profile'>profile page</a>.</p>",
    "section": "Workers"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do workers support multiple models?",
    "answer": "<p>Yes! Workers can be configured to serve multiple models simultaneously. When you make a request, you can specify which model you want to use, or leave the model unspecified to receive the first available model from any worker that picks up your job.</p><p>Workers that serve multiple models earn increased uptime kudos (awarded every 10 minutes), reflecting their higher value to the community. Check the <a href='/details/models'>models page</a> to see which models are currently available.</p>",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I prioritize myself and my friends on my own worker?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it called \"AI Horde\"?",
    "answer": "<p>This project began as a way to consolidate resources for the KoboldAI Client. We needed a name, so I chose something thematic for \"Kobolds\": \"A Horde of Kobolds.\" When image generation was added later, we kept the \"AI Horde\" name.</p>",

    "section": "Horde"
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the horde spy on my prompts and generations?",
    "answer": "<p>No, the AI Horde itself does not store such details for surveillance or data collection purposes. Prompts and generations are only stored in memory temporarily during processing and are deleted shortly after the generation is delivered or canceled.</p><p>The system retains requests only long enough to facilitate job processing and result retrieval. Once you've retrieved your results or the request expires, the data is permanently removed from our systems. Read our <a href='/privacy'>privacy policy</a> for more details.</p>",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why should I use the Horde instead of my local PC?",
    "answer": "<p>The AI Horde democratizes access to generative AI technologies. Not everyone has a powerful GPU in their PC, and the horde allows anyone to use fast Stable Diffusion and Large Language Models, regardless of their hardware or financial means.</p><p>Additional benefits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> No expensive graphics cards required—use it even on your phone through <a href='/guis-and-tools'>browser-based frontends</a>.</li><li><strong>Easy Setup:</strong> No complex Python dependencies or error-prone local installations to manage.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth Savings:</strong> No need to download large models (which can be gigabytes in size).</li><li><strong>Developer-Friendly:</strong> If you're building a service on image or text generation, you can use the horde infrastructure without the complexity and costs of setting up your own servers.</li></ul><p>Read more about our <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/why.md' target='_blank'>motivations and commitment to accessibility</a>.</p>",
    "section": "Horde"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should I use the Horde instead of a service like Stability.ai?",
    "answer": "<p>Because the AI Horde is completely free! You will never need to pay to use the horde. If demand is high, your delivery speed may be slower, but that's also true for other services like Midjourney.</p><p>Second, the horde gives you all the benefits of a local installation—such as prompt freedom and model choice—while still providing a convenient <a href='/guis-and-tools'>browser interface</a> and flexibility.</p><p>Finally, unlike many commercial services, the horde provides a fully-fledged <a href='https://aihorde.net/api' target='_blank'>REST API</a> you can use to integrate your applications without worrying about ongoing costs or usage limits.</p>",
    "section": "Horde"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should I use the Horde instead of a free service?",
    "answer": "<p>Because when the service is free, you're the product!</p><p>Other services running on centralized servers have costs—someone has to pay for electricity and infrastructure. The AI Horde is transparent about how these costs are crowdsourced through <a href='/contribute/joining'>volunteer workers</a>, and there is no need for us to change our model in the future.</p><p>Other \"free\" services are often vague about how they use your data or explicitly state that your data is the product. Such services may eventually monetize through advertising, data brokering, or subscription paywalls. The AI Horde operates on a <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/why.md' target='_blank'>not-for-profit basis</a> and is committed to remaining free and open-source.</p><p>Additionally, many of these services do not provide free REST APIs. If you need to integrate with them, you must use a browser interface designed to serve ads or collect data.</p>",

  {
    "question": "Can I run my own private horde?",
    "answer": "<p>Of course! This software is <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org' target='_blank'>FOSS (Free and Open Source)</a>, and you are welcome to use, modify, and share it, as long as you respect the AGPL3 license.</p>",
    "section": "Horde"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I build paid service integrations into the AI Horde?",
    "answer": "<p>Yes, with important restrictions. Due to the voluntary nature of the AI Horde, <strong>you must give back to the AI Horde at least as much as you take out to make a profit</strong>. This ensures that paid services don't extract value from volunteer contributions without reciprocating.</p><p>In practice, this means if you're building a paid service on top of the horde, you should run workers that contribute at least as many kudos as your paid users consume. This maintains the balance and fairness of the system.</p><p>Please see the detailed explanation in <a href='https://dbzer0.com/blog/what-about-paid-services-on-top-of-the-ai-horde/' target='_blank'>this devlog</a> for specific guidelines and examples.</p>",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I request NSFW images or text?",
    "answer": "<p>Yes, but you may have a smaller pool of workers to fulfill your request, which can result in longer generation times. Check the <a href='/details/workers'>active workers page</a> to see how many workers are currently serving NSFW requests.</p>",
    "section": "Not Safe for Work"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you censor generations?",
    "answer": "<p>Horde-wide, we censor only one type of generation: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material' target='_blank'>CSAM</a> (Child Sexual Abuse Material) images. We use multiple mechanisms to prevent this: a regex replacement filter during the initial API request and an anti-CSAM AI running on each worker. See the detailed answers below for more information.</p><p>Other than CSAM prevention, the horde does not censor text generations or images. We are committed to providing prompt freedom and open access to generative AI technologies.</p><p>However, individual workers may have their own censorship guidelines based on their operator's preferences or local laws, and each requestor can voluntarily opt in to accidental NSFW filtering.</p>",
    "section": "Not Safe for Work"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are some of my images just black with white text?",
    "answer": "<p>Those generations have been NSFW-censored by the worker that generated them.</p><p>If you specified your request as SFW (Safe For Work), individual SFW workers who fulfill it may have an NSFW censorship model active, which will return this black warning image if it detects potentially explicit content. To avoid such images, enable NSFW in your request settings or ensure your prompt is clearly SFW.</p><p>If the image is censored due to the anti-CSAM filter, this cannot be disabled as it is a mandatory safety measure across all workers.</p>",
    "section": "Not Safe for Work"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are some of my images still censored even though I'm requesting NSFW?",
    "answer": "<p>Each worker can optionally define a censor list. If any word from that list is found in your prompt, the worker will automatically apply post-processing using an NSFW censorship model.</p><p>These censor lists typically contain terms that should never be combined with NSFW content or could cause legal issues for the worker operator based on their local laws.</p><p>If your images are censored, you can try resubmitting the prompt to potentially get a different worker, or consider adjusting your prompt. If you believe a worker is using the censor list maliciously or improperly, please contact us with your prompt and the worker's name via our <a href='https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn' target='_blank'>Discord server</a>, and we'll investigate.</p>",
    "section": "Not Safe for Work"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you explain how the Anti-CSAM regex filter works?",
    "answer": "<p>When an image request first enters the AI Horde, it passes through a private regex filter that looks for a combination of two contexts: \"Underage\" and \"Lewd.\" For example, \"child\" is an underage context, and \"without clothes\" is a lewd context.</p><p>If neither or only one of these contexts is detected in a prompt, the prompt is allowed through. For example, \"child in the playground\" is fine, as is \"without clothes in the bathroom.\"</p><p>If both contexts are present, the regex protection is triggered with two possible responses:</p><ul><li><strong>Replacement Mode:</strong> If <code>replacement_filter</code> is <code>true</code> in your API payload and the prompt is under 1000 characters, each triggering term is automatically replaced with an \"adult\" version (e.g., \"school\" becomes \"university\"). This aims to guide the inference toward safe content.</li><li><strong>Block Mode:</strong> If <code>replacement_filter</code> is <code>false</code> or your prompt exceeds 1000 characters, the request is automatically blocked, and your IP receives a temporary timeout for a few minutes. This timeout increases with repeated offenses to prevent attempts to reverse-engineer the filter.</li></ul>",
