    "answer": "<p>When an image <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#request' target='_blank'>request</a> first enters the AI Horde, it passes through a private regex filter that looks for a combination of two contexts: \"Underage\" and \"Lewd.\" For example, \"child\" is an underage context, and \"without clothes\" is a lewd context.</p><p>If neither or only one of these contexts is detected in a prompt, the prompt is allowed through. For example, \"child in the playground\" is fine, as is \"without clothes in the bathroom.\"</p><p>If both contexts are present, the regex protection is triggered with two possible responses:</p><ul><li><strong>Replacement Mode:</strong> If <code>replacement_filter</code> is <code>true</code> in your <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#api' target='_blank'>API</a> <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#payload' target='_blank'>payload</a> and the prompt is under 1000 characters, each triggering term is automatically replaced with an \"adult\" version (e.g., \"school\" becomes \"university\"). This aims to guide the inference toward safe content.</li><li><strong>Block Mode:</strong> If <code>replacement_filter</code> is <code>false</code> or your prompt exceeds 1000 characters, the request is automatically blocked, and your IP receives a temporary timeout for a few minutes. This timeout increases with repeated offenses to prevent attempts to reverse-engineer the filter.</li></ul>",
