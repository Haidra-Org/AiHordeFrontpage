    "question": "Do you censor generations?",
    "answer": "<p>Horde-wide, we censor only one type of generation: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material' target='_blank'>CSAM</a> images. We use two mechanisms: a regex replacement filter during the initial <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#api' target='_blank'>API</a> <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#request' target='_blank'>request</a> and an anti-CSAM AI running on each <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#worker' target='_blank'>worker</a>.

    "section": "Not Safe for Work"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are some of my images still censored even though I'm requesting NSFW?",
    "answer": "<p>Each <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#worker' target='_blank'>worker</a> can optionally define a censor list. If any word from that list is found, the worker will automatically <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#post-processing' target='_blank'>post-process</a> using an <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#nsfw-filter' target='_blank'>NSFW censorship model</a>.

For example, \"child in the playground\" is fine, as is \"without clothes in the bathroom.\"</p><p>If both terms are present, the regex protection is triggered. This has two modes:</p><p>If <code>replacement_filter</code> is <code>true</code> in your <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#api' target='_blank'>API</a> <a href='https://github.com/Haidra-Org/haidra-assets/blob/main/docs/definitions.md#payload' target='_blank'>payload</a> and the prompt is under 1000 characters, each triggering term is automatically replaced with an \"adult\" version. For example, \"school\" becomes \"university.\" This aims to guide the inference toward safe content.</p><p>If <code>replacement_filter</code> is <code>false</code> or your prompt exceeds 1000 characters, the request is automatically blocked, and your IP receives a timeout for a few minutes.
